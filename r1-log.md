The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 9th Friday 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
***Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com***
Started on a website clone using HTML and CSS,copied the latout from another example but wrote all code from scratch. Got the page completed about 50%.

### R1D2
Started work on a website for the local Under 13's Football League, hoping to get it finished within the week ready so they can post the Grand Final and Presentation Evening Awards on it. Created the Nav Bar.

### R1D3
Continued work on the football site, found and organised all of the images and logos for the page. Started on the Main Page.
Didn't get as much done today as I would have liked, felling a bit under the weather. Hopefully can be more productive tomorrow.

### R1D4
Completed a dropdown menu after playing around trying to create an animated hamburger menu that I had problems with. Resorted to a plain dropdown until I can make the other version work.

### R1D5
Registration and Signup Pages are created (no backend yet still have to work that out). All pages are linking properly.

### R1D6
Missed a couple of days caught up doing other things which I'm disappointed about. Although I began the Backend section of Colt's Web Developer Boot Camp so it wasn't completely unproductive.

### R1D7
Setup GOORM IDE and MongoDB and played around with running a database from the Bootcamp Lessons

### R1D8
More of the Bootcamp also found some good sources of ideas for various Web Apps and other things to build to help learn coding skills, will start some of these projects soon.

### R1D9 
Working on the Bootcamp using Node working on GoormIDE and MongoDB.

### R1D10
Still working on the same stuff as above, starting to work on building simple apps using the above tools.
